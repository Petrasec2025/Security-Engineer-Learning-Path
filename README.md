## 👋 Hi and Welcome

Hi there — welcome to my **professional Security Engineer Learning Path portfolio**!  
I’m documenting my entire **hands-on learning journey** toward becoming a **Security Engineer**, and I’d love for you to follow along as I build, test, and secure real-world systems.

This repository is my central hub for tracking progress, labs, notes, and reflections across **network, system, and software security**, as well as **risk management and incident response**.  

Whether you're a **mentor**, **recruiter**, or a **fellow learner**, I hope this project gives you a clear view of my technical growth, consistency, and passion for cybersecurity engineering.  

---

## 🎯 Objective

To gain a practical and comprehensive understanding of **security engineering fundamentals** by working through structured topics that mirror real-world responsibilities of a Security Engineer:

- 🧩 **Network Security Engineering** — Designing and protecting secure network architectures  
- 💻 **System Security Engineering** — Hardening Linux, Windows, and Active Directory environments  
- 🧱 **Software Security Engineering** — Understanding OWASP, SSDLC, SAST, and DAST  
- ⚖️ **Risk & Incident Management** — Applying governance, threat modelling, and response techniques  

---

## 📘 Repository Layout

Each folder in this repository corresponds to a section of the Security Engineer learning path.  
Inside each section, you’ll find **individual subfolders** (called “rooms”) — each containing a dedicated `README.md` documenting:

- 🎓 **Learning goals**
- 🧰 **Tools used**
- 🧩 **Key takeaways**
- 🌍 **Real-world relevance**
- 🧑‍💻 **Hands-on exercises**
- 🧠 **Reflections**

## 🏆 Certificate of Completion

I’ll upload my **official certificate** once I’ve completed the entire path.  
Each section will also include screenshots and documentation from practical labs.

---

## 💡 Technologies & Tools

I’ll be working with (and documenting hands-on experience using):

- 🐧 **Kali Linux**, **Ubuntu**, and **Windows Server**
- 🧰 **Wireshark**, **Splunk**, **Metasploit**, **Burp Suite**
- ☁️ **AWS**, **Azure**, and **Docker/Containers**
- 🔐 **OpenVAS**, **Nmap**, **pfSense**, **Security Onion**
- 🧠 **Python** for automation and scripting

---

## 🌍 Real-World Alignment

This learning path aligns with **real Security Engineer and SOC Analyst roles**, combining blue team and red team perspectives.  
I’ve **completed CompTIA Security+ and EC-Council CEH**, and I’m **currently focused on CompTIA CySA+ labs**.  
Alongside this, I’m actively participating in **Blue Team labs** and simulations through **TryHackMe, Hack The Box, LetsDefend, Blue Team Labs Online, and CyberDefenders CTF** — gaining practical hands-on experience in **SOC operations and security engineering**.
