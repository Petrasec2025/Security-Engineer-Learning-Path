## 📚 Detailed Knowledge Gained

### 🔍 Task 2: Vulnerability Management Fundamentals

**Key Distinction:**
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Technical process of identifying vulnerabilities
- **Vulnerability Management**: Comprehensive process encompassing scanning, risk assessment, remediation, and reporting

**Answer Confirmed:** 
- The process encompassing vulnerability scanning and other factors is **vulnerability management**
- Overall objective is to **decrease** organizational risk exposure (nay)

### 📊 Task 3: Vulnerability Classification Systems

**Mastered Standards:**
- **CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)**: Standardized vulnerability identifiers
- **CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System)**: Severity scoring (0-10 scale)
- **CPE (Common Platform Enumeration)**: Asset classification
- **CCE (Common Configuration Enumeration)**: Configuration issue identifiers

**Practical Application:**
- CVE-2013-1048: CVSS 4.6, Access Complexity: Low
- CVE ID structure understanding: CVE-2023-2022 → Year assigned: 2023

### 🔧 Task 4: Discovery & Prioritization Phase

**Hands-on Experience:**
- Configured and executed vulnerability scans using Greenbone Community Edition
- Analyzed scan results for Ubuntu target system
- Prioritized vulnerabilities based on severity and business impact

**Scan Results Analysis:**
- Medium-level vulnerabilities: **1**
- ICMP Timestamp Reply severity: **2.1**
- Target OS identification: **Ubuntu 20.04**

### 📈 Task 5: Assessment & Reporting Phase

**Assessment Skills Developed:**
- Vulnerability validation and false positive identification
- Risk baseline establishment
- Impact analysis and solution recommendation

**Reporting Competencies:**
- Vulnerability with "Workaround" solution type: **Medium severity**
- "TCP timestamps" solution type: **Mitigation**
- Professional report generation in multiple formats

### 🛠️ Task 6: Remediation & Verification

**Remediation Workflow Mastered:**
- Ticket creation and assignment processes
- Remediation priority determination for critical vulnerabilities: **High**
- Verification through rescanning and validation

### 🏛️ Task 7: NIST Cybersecurity Framework
