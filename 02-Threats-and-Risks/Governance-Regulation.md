## 🧭 Introduction
Cybersecurity is an ever-evolving landscape where malicious actors constantly attempt to exploit vulnerabilities for data theft, disruption, or damage.  
To combat these threats, **strong information security governance and regulation** are vital.  
This involves creating policies, monitoring compliance, and ensuring adherence to global standards like **ISO 27001** and **NIST 800-53**.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Understand the **importance of governance and regulation** in cybersecurity.  
- Learn about **international laws, standards, and guidelines** (GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, etc.).  
- Explore the **GRC Framework (Governance, Risk, and Compliance)** and how it supports cybersecurity maturity.  
- Develop awareness of **ISO 27001**, **NIST 800-53**, and **NIST 800-63B** frameworks.

## 🧩 Key Concepts

### 🔹 Governance vs Regulation vs Compliance
| Term | Definition |
|------|-------------|
| **Governance** | Directing and managing an organization to achieve objectives and ensure compliance. |
| **Regulation** | Rules/laws enforced by governing bodies to ensure compliance and protect data. |
| **Compliance** | Adherence to relevant laws, regulations, and standards. |

---

## 🧱 Information Security Governance
Security governance ensures that an organization’s **confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA)** principles are maintained through:

- **Strategy:** Security roadmap aligned with business objectives.  
- **Policies & Procedures:** Clear, actionable rules for protecting assets.  
- **Risk Management:** Identify, assess, and mitigate threats.  
- **Performance Measurement:** Use KPIs to measure effectiveness.  
- **Compliance:** Follow industry best practices and regulatory standards.  

---

## ⚖️ Information Security Regulation
Regulations establish the **legal and ethical boundaries** for handling sensitive data.  
Examples include:

| Law/Standard | Domain | Description |
|---------------|--------|-------------|
| **GDPR** | Data Privacy | EU regulation ensuring lawful personal data handling. |
| **HIPAA** | Healthcare | Protects the privacy of health information. |
| **PCI DSS** | Financial | Governs secure processing of payment card data. |
| **GLBA** | Financial | Protects consumers’ private financial information. |

**Benefits:** Stronger security posture, stakeholder trust, legal compliance, better decision-making, and competitive advantage.

---

## 🧩 Information Security Frameworks
Frameworks help standardize and document an organization’s approach to cybersecurity.

| Document Type | Purpose |
|----------------|----------|
| **Policies** | Define high-level principles and goals. |
| **Standards** | Establish technical or procedural requirements. |
| **Guidelines** | Recommend best practices (non-mandatory). |
| **Procedures** | Define specific steps for performing a task. |
| **Baselines** | Minimum acceptable security standards. |

### 🔁 Governance Document Lifecycle
1. **Identify Scope & Purpose**  
2. **Research & Review**  
3. **Draft Document**  
4. **Review & Approve**  
5. **Implement & Communicate**  
6. **Review & Update** ✅

## 🏢 Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)
**GRC** integrates the processes for managing governance, risk, and compliance effectively.  

### 🔹 Components
- **Governance:** Defines direction, policies, and performance metrics.  
- **Risk Management:** Identifies, assesses, and mitigates risks.  
- **Compliance:** Ensures alignment with legal and regulatory requirements.  

### 🧱 Steps to Build a GRC Program
1. Define scope and objectives.  
2. Conduct risk assessments.  
3. Develop policies and procedures.  
4. Establish governance processes.  
5. Implement controls (technical & administrative).  
6. Monitor and measure performance.  
7. Continuously improve.

## 🔐 Privacy & Data Protection

### 🏛️ GDPR
- Protects personal data of EU residents.  
- Requires consent for data collection.  
- Enforces strong penalties for non-compliance (up to **4%** of annual revenue or €20M).  

### 💳 PCI DSS
- Secures cardholder data (CHD).  
- Mandates encryption, access controls, and monitoring.  

---

## 🧰 NIST Frameworks

### 📘 NIST 800-53  
Provides a catalogue of controls across **20 control families**, covering:
- **Access Control**
- **Incident Response**
- **Media Protection**
- **System & Communications Protection**
- **Program Management**

### 🔐 NIST 800-63B  
Defines digital identity management and authentication best practices (passwords, biometrics, tokens).

---

## 🌐 ISO/IEC 27001
An internationally recognized standard for building and maintaining an **Information Security Management System (ISMS)**.

**Core Components:**
- Scope  
- Security Policy  
- Risk Assessment & Treatment  
- Statement of Applicability (SoA)  
- Internal Audit  
- Management Review  

---

## 🧾 SOC 2
A **data security audit framework** by the AICPA, focusing on:
- **Confidentiality**
- **Availability**
- **Integrity**
- **Privacy**

**SOC 2 Audit Process:**
1. Determine scope.  
2. Choose auditor.  
3. Plan and prepare.  
4. Conduct audit.  
5. Receive report.
